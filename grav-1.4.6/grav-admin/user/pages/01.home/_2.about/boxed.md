# About  
  
Artificial Intelligence is now the most sought after technology in industry and research. Computational Intelligence (CI) is the evolution of AI technology and adopted by industry giants for commercial use. Many start-ups have spotted business opportunities that provide CI based solutions to customers. The greatest issue with CI in India and globally is that of manpower, training and awareness of the latest cutting edge. Hence there is a strong need for developing skills in the areas of CI technology know how and implementations. This requirement motivated IEEE Hyderabad Chapter to organize a summer school with the support of IEEE CIS.
  
The present program comprises of tutorials and hands-on session by renowned distinguished speakers both from industry and academia. It is designed for young professionals working in IT industry, graduate student members, post-doc and young researchers who want to develop skills in computational intelligence and related areas. The main objective is to stimulate participantsâ€™ interests in rapidly evolving fields of CI. The participants would get an opportunity to connect with peer researchers, local industry and academicians working in the areas of CI. A tour to T-Hub, the famous Hyderabad Start-ups Center is planned where participants would be meeting the innovators from AI start-ups.
